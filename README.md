# Rank To Batch Allocator

## This is written in C++
### This project is designed to automate the following process:
We need to allocate batches to students based on their ranks in an exam.

1. Each student will give their preference of batches.
2. The program will take students rank-wise.
3. It will allocate them the best preference possible provided that there can be 30 students in each batch.
